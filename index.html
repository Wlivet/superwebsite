<!--Ok Wlivet This is your code
So <!DOCTYPE html> Is what you have to do at first on a html code ALWAYs
then u gotta do <html> Becouse thats the code yk
    Then if u wanna name the website let it be <title>Website</title> But remeber this has to be in head
then for the body + more you write something in body it shows in the website as a text
if u want to make the sentance bigger you do it <h1>Hi Guys</h1>
To add a Line under the Text you do <hr> and done to make so the text goes down
Do <Br> thats basicly all you need to remeber for first episode of brocode-->
